# Car_Prediction
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

I analyzed acar dataset using linear regression and random forests based on the following steps:
1] Data Analysis
2] Data Cleaning(Delete duplicates etc..)
3] Data Munging (Outliers, Null values treated with imputing technique)
4] Data Visualization
5] Machine learning (Regression & Randome Forest)
